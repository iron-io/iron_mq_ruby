IronMQ Ruby Client
-------------

The [full API documentation is here](http://dev.iron.io/mq/reference/api/) and this client tries to stick to the API as
much as possible so if you see an option in the API docs, you can use it in the methods below.

http://dev.iron.io/mq/reference/api/

#Getting Started

1\. Install the gem:

```ruby
gem install iron_mq
```

2\. Setup your Iron.io credentials: http://dev.iron.io/mq/reference/configuration/

3\. Create an IronMQ client object:

```ruby
ironmq = IronMQ::Client.new
```

Or pass in credentials:

```ruby
ironmq = IronMQ::Client.new(:token => "MY_TOKEN", :project_id => "MY_PROJECT_ID")
```

#The Basics

###Get a Queue Object

You can have as many queues as you want, each with their own unique set of messages.

```ruby
queue = ironmq.queue("my_queue")
```

Now you can use it.

### Post a Message on a Queue

Messages are placed on the queue in a FIFO arrangement.
If a queue does not exist, it will be created upon the first posting of a message.

```ruby
queue.post("hello world!")
```

### Retrieve Queue Information

```ruby
queue.info # => {"id"=>"5127bf043264140e863e2283", "name"=>"my_queue", ...}
queue.id   # => "5127bf043264140e863e2283"
```

### Get a Message off a Queue

```ruby
msg = queue.get
msg.body # => "hello world!"
```

When you pop/get a message from the queue, it is no longer on the queue but it still exists within the system.
You have to explicitly delete the message or else it will go back onto the queue after the `timeout`.
The default `timeout` is 60 seconds. Minimal `timeout` is 30 seconds.

### Delete a Message from a Queue

```ruby
msg.delete
# or
queue.delete(msg.id)
```

Be sure to delete a message from the queue when you're done with it.


#Client

`IronMQ::Client` is based on `IronCore::Client` and provides easy access to the queues and messages.

```ruby
ironmq = IronMQ::Client.new(:token => "MY_TOKEN", :project_id => "MY_PROJECT_ID")
```

### List Queues

```ruby
all_queues = ironmq.queues.list # => [#<IronMQ::Queue:...>, ...]
# or
all_queues = ironmq.queues.all  # => [#<IronMQ::Queue:...>, ...]
```

**Optional parameters:**

* `page`: The 0-based page to view. The default is 0.
* `per_page`: The number of queues to return per page. The default is 30, the maximum is 100.

```ruby
queues = ironmq.queues.all(:page => 1, :per_page => 10)
```

### Get Queue by Name

```ruby
queue = ironmq.queue "my_queue" # => #<IronMQ::Queue:...>
```

**Note:** if queue with desired name does not exist it returns fake queue.
Queue will be created automatically on post of first message or queue configuration update.

#Queues

### Retrieve Queue Information

```ruby
info = queue.info # => {"id"=>"5127bf043264140e863e2283", "name"=>"my_queue", ...}
```

Shortcuts for `queue.info[key]`:

```ruby
id = queue.id # => "5127bf043264140e863e2283"
# Does queue exists on server? Alias for `queue.id.nil?`
is_new = queue.new? # => false

size = queue.size # => 7
name = queue.name # => "my_queue"
overall_messages = queue.total_messages # => 13
subscribers = queue.subscribers # => [{"url" => "http://..."}, ...]

push_type = queue.push_type # => "multicast"
# Does queue Push Queue? Alias for `queue.push_type.nil?`
is_push_queue = queue.push_queue? # => true
```

**Warning:** to be sure configuration information is up-to-date
client library call IronMQ API each time you request for any parameter except `queue.name`.
In this case you may prefer to use `queue.info` to have `Hash` with all available info parameters.

### Delete a Message Queue

```ruby
response = queue.delete_queue # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
```

### Post Messages to a Queue

**Single message:**

```ruby
response = queue.post("something helpful") # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
# or
response = queue.post("with parameteres", :timeout => 300) # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>

message_id = response.id # => "5847899158098068288"
status_message = response.msg # => "Messages put on queue."
http_code = response.code # => 200
```

**Multiple messages:**
```ruby
# [{:body => VALUE}, ...] format is required
messages = [{:body => "first"}, {:body => "second"}]

response = queue.post(messages) # => {"ids" => ["5847899158098068288", ...], "msg" => "Messages put on queue."}
# or
response = queue.post(messages, :timeout => 300) # => {"ids" => ["5847899158098068288", ...], "msg" => "Messages put on queue."}
```

**Optional parameters:**

* `timeout`: After timeout (in seconds), item will be placed back onto queue.
You must delete the message from the queue to ensure it does not go back onto the queue.
 Default is 60 seconds. Minimum is 30 seconds. Maximum is 86,400 seconds (24 hours).

* `delay`: The item will not be available on the queue until this many seconds have passed.
Default is 0 seconds. Maximum is 604,800 seconds (7 days).

* `expires_in`: How long in seconds to keep the item on the queue before it is deleted.
Default is 604,800 seconds (7 days). Maximum is 2,592,000 seconds (30 days).

### Get Messages from a Queue

```ruby
message = queue.get # => #<IronMQ::Message:...>

# or N messages
messages = queue.get(:n => 7) # => [#<IronMQ::Message:...>, ...]

# or message by ID
message = queue.get "5127bf043264140e863e2283" # => #<IronMQ::Message:...>
```

**Optional parameters:**

* `n`: The maximum number of messages to get. Default is 1. Maximum is 100.

* `timeout`: timeout: After timeout (in seconds), item will be placed back onto queue.
You must delete the message from the queue to ensure it does not go back onto the queue.
If not set, value from POST is used. Default is 60 seconds. Minimum is 30 seconds.
Maximum is 86,400 seconds (24 hours).

When `n` parameter is specified and greater than 1 method returns `Array` of `Queue`s.
Otherwise, `Queue` object would be returned.

### Touch a Message on a Queue

Touching a reserved message extends its timeout by the duration specified when the message was created, which is 60 seconds by default.

```ruby
message = queue.get # => #<IronMQ::Message:...>

message.touch # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
```

### Release Message

```ruby
message = queue.get => #<IronMQ::Message:...>

response = message.release # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
# or
response = message.release(:delay => 42) # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
```

**Optional parameters:**

* `delay`: The item will not be available on the queue until this many seconds have passed.
Default is 0 seconds. Maximum is 604,800 seconds (7 days).

### Delete a Message from a Queue

```ruby
message = queue.get # => #<IronMQ::Queue:...>

message.delete # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
# or
queue.delete_message(message.id) # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
```

### Peek Messages from a Queue

Peeking at a queue returns the next messages on the queue, but it does not reserve them.

```ruby
message = queue.peek # => #<IronMQ::Message:...>
# or multiple messages
messages = queue.peek(:n => 13) # => [#<IronMQ::Message:...>, ...]
```

**Optional parameters:**

* `n`: The maximum number of messages to peek. Default is 1. Maximum is 100.

### Poll for Messages

```ruby
queue.poll { |msg| puts msg.body }
```

Polling will automatically delete the message at the end of the block.

### Clear a Queue

```ruby
queue.clear # => #<IronMQ::ResponseBase:...>
```

#Push Queues

IronMQ push queues allow you to setup a queue that will push to an endpoint, rather than having to poll the endpoint. 
[Here's the announcement for an overview](http://blog.iron.io/2013/01/ironmq-push-queues-reliable-message.html). 

### Update a Message Queue

```ruby
queue_info = queue.update(options) # => {"id"=>"5127bf043264140e863e2283", "name"=>"my_queue", ...}
```

**The following parameters are all related to Push Queues:**

* `subscribers`: An array of subscriber hashes containing a “url” field.
This set of subscribers will replace the existing subscribers.
To add or remove subscribers, see the add subscribers endpoint or the remove subscribers endpoint.
See below for example json.
* `push_type`: Either `multicast` to push to all subscribers or `unicast` to push to one and only one subscriber. Default is `multicast`.
* `retries`: How many times to retry on failure. Default is 3.
* `retries_delay`: Delay between each retry in seconds. Default is 60.

### Set Subscribers on a Queue

Subscribers can be any HTTP endpoint. `push_type` is one of:

* `multicast`: will push to all endpoints/subscribers
* `unicast`: will push to one and only one endpoint/subscriber

```ruby
ptype = :multicast
subscribers = [
  {url: "http://rest-test.iron.io/code/200?store=key1"}
  {url: "http://rest-test.iron.io/code/200?store=key2"}
]

queue.update(:subscribers => subscribers, :push_type => ptype)
```

### Add/Remove Subscribers on a Queue

```ruby
queue.add_subscriber({url: "http://nowhere.com"})

queue.remove_subscriber({url: "http://nowhere.com"})
```

### Get Message Push Status

After pushing a message:

```ruby
subscribers = queue.get(msg.id).subscribers # => [#<IronMQ::Subscriber:...>, ...]
# old syntax, still supported
subscribers = queue.messages.get(msg.id).subscribers # => [#<IronMQ::Subscriber:...>, ...]

subscribers.each { |ss| puts "#{ss.id}: #{(ss.code == 200) ? 'Success' : 'Fail'}" }
```

Returns an array of subscribers with status.

### Delete Message Push Status

```ruby
subscribers = queue.get(msg.id).subscribers # => [#<IronMQ::Subscriber:...>, ...]

subscribers.each { |ss| ss.delete }
```
